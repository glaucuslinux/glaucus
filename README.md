glaucus is an independent, open-source, general-purpose, bleeding-edge, 
rolling-release, source-based Linux® distribution based on musl libc and toybox,
built from scratch around the suckless philosophy without sacrificing
convenience.

Optimized for performance and size, glaucus strives to be as fast and minimal as
